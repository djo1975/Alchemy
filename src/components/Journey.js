      <p>
        The journey with stones is designed for the client to create a personal
        Universal Mandala. During each session, the client draws 5 stones or
        symbols. It takes 8 sessions to complete the entire process. Finally,
        the client receives symbolic formulas, how to work on the physical
        level. How to correct his or her wrong behavior, the client becomes
        aware of his emotional habits, functions and, most importantly, frees
        himself from mental limitations. In other words, each client with a
        different distribution of symbols where some are "Closed" in a negative
        position receives a method of transformation of, or what is blocked,
        neglected in life. There is no future in this process, only the past is
        reflected here, the traumas from the past, which can be realized in a
        moment and transformed into wisdom beyond dualism.
