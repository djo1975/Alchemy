        <p>Alchemy through stone, the hardest material on planet Earth, was waiting for this very moment to come to light. This unique method can be accessible to anyone who wants to improve their inner work. The method is designed to, in a studious and serious way, through the language of archetypes, i.e. symbols, provide valuable help towards the realization of wisdom. Each stone has not only a symbolic meaning but also a numerological value. It is not difficult to understand that this system combines psychology and esoteric knowledge. If you practice the Alchemy of stones, you will see that in each stone you have a wise, faithful and sincere companion, and there are 41 of them. The stones will guide you through symbolism in discovering your unrealistic fantasies, limitations on the path of transformation from ignorance to knowledge. If you want to see changes before your eyes, you have to start with inner changes, daily insight towards transformation, getting out of safe territory. Alchemy as a system of divination will help you see everything as a mirror of your karma or in other words to integrate and understand your destiny that lies ahead. The Journey with stones is a different method than divination. It functions by being able to detect, to see the intersection, crossing or resetting moments in life. The Journey gives you that opportunity to face all the habits that don't allow you to start new cycles. It will help you gain insight into how the past has conditioned you and where the current obstacles to further progress are. Symbolic formulas will raise your conscious. It is possible to be initiated into this method and become a practitioner and life coach, through the Stones. For that you have to create your own set and find 41 stones. In other words, to be initiated by mother earth through the stone. To be more direct this method is path to the shamanic practice. As a founder and pioneering of this unique knowledge, I invite you to make contact with the stones and allow them to guide you to inner light and knowledge. This site was designed so that, in addition to the book, it also contains examples that would help anyone who wants to practice this method gain more knowledge and become independent practitioner of stone reading.</p>
