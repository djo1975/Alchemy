      <h1>Initiation and journey with stones</h1>
      <p>
        Initiation in this method is intended for people who have experience in
        working with people, that is, psychologists, various therapists and
        life coaches. In the case of training, 16 sessions are needed, in order
        to have 2 sessions per week. It is best not to interrupt the process
        and build symbolic formulas over time, observe the process and prepare
        for the next session. During this journey with Stones, the client
        should, in addition to the book Alchemy of Stones, expand his symbolic
        knowledge through the book: Dictionary of Symbols, written by J.
        Chevalier and A. Gheerbrant. The client will be offered supervision in
        the following work as support until he gains confidence in this method
        and becomes independent. Of course, it is desirable that people also
        have basic knowledge about Kabbalah and the teachings of the tree of
        life. On this occasion, Slavica, as the founder of the method, invites
        you to deep inner work, where all your future clients will be a mirror
        of your work and the path of transformation.
